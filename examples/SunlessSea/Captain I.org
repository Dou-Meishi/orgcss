* Captain's Making

[[./pics/Captain's Making.PNG]]

Three decades ago, in the region of Victoria, London was stolen by /bats/. Now it lies a mile below /the surface/.

It was dreadfully inconvenient for everyone. But it opened a vast black ocean to you. Welcome to /the Underzee/.

- ~Choose a Past~

You now lodge in a Room above /the Blind Helmsman/.

** Who Were You

Now you're a captain: now you belong to the Underzee. But who were you, before?

- ~A natural philosopher~

Your peculiar theories on time, blood and starlight brought you down to /the Neath/, the cavern where London lies...and now they take you out to zee.

Your acquaintance, /the Plausible Surgeon/, will serve as ship's doctor: until you find someone better.

** Choose An Ambition

What does winning mean to you?

- ~Wealth~

You know how it is to be poor. Now you want a mansion, servants, fine clothes. A family, perhaps.

The Underzee is full of riches. Death and darkness, too, but it's worth the gamble.

** A Last Scrap of Paperwork

Captain! Captain! An irregularity in the Harbourmaster's office! They wish to know - what term of address you prefer ashore?

- ~Captain~

'Captain' will do perfactly ashore as well as at sea. Thank you.

*Captain it is!*

#+begin_center
/A last piece of advice: explore. Take chances. This captain will probably die. The zee is hungry. But each captain passes on lessons to the next.../
#+end_center

* Fallen London

[[./pics/fallen-london.PNG]]

FALLEN LONDON! Deep, dark and marvellous. All voyages start here: and this is where successful voyages end.

- ~Advice For Captains~

The much-lamented M. Demeaux found a watery grave long, long ago. Probably you will end no better. But if you read this book of invaluable advice, your chances will improve.

- ~Sell this Book~

You are a vertern captain, and require no more advice? Very well, then.

*Sold!*

Someone else will better appreciate M. Demeaux's work.

- ~A Zubmarinar Tutorial~

Welcome, delicious friend!

- ~How to accquire a zubmarine~

Her Majesty's Admiralty has sworn off zubmarine exploration. However, you've heard tales of unofficial research into zubmarine travel being conducted in her distant colony.

#+begin_center
/Travel to the Southern coast, and follow it east to find Port Carnelian. There, you will learn how to convert your ship into a zubmarine. Be sure you're prepared for the journey!/
#+end_center

- ~Your Lodgings~

Here you may catch up with your correspondence, rest or retire altogether from the sea-faring life. The better your lodgins, the better your quality of retirement. Naturally.

- ~Read the Morning Papers~

The unexpurgated Gazette, the Magazine Formally Known as London Magazine, the Spiteful Trumpeter. News.

*News from home*

/The Echo Bazaar/, that enigmatic marketplace, has increased its tax on love stories. /The Traitor Empress/ has forbidden singing in the street outside her palace. The anarchists of /the Calendar Council/ has inexplicably dynamited a drinking-fountain. /The Ministry of Public Decency/ has located and destroyed a nest of gallblighter wasps...  

- ~London!~

She is the greaties city on the Underzee. And don't you forget it.

- ~Adopt a Blemmigan Gallivanter~

A Blemmigan sits atop a splintered crate, clinking and whistling at captains as they come near.

*A poliet bow*

You extend your hand and the Blemmigan leaps on. Its tendrils entwine with your fingers, and it chitters quietly. It meets your gaze and bobs its dome in greeting. It's very small - is it old enough for naval services? You're pretty sure its moustache has been drawn on in pen, in an attempt to look older. As you approach your ship's gangplank, the creature flutes and vibrates with apparent happiness. The bosun winces as you bring it aboard.

- ~Visit the Admiralty's Survey Office~

They'll pay for information from zee-captains. Find out what, and how.

** The Admiralty Survey Office

The Admiralty's picket fleets and intelligence networks are long gone. The Survey Office pays zee-captains a small sum for recent information.

- ~Ask if there's anything in particular they need~

"Well, if we can be assured of your discretion - "

*"This port - "*

"Speak to our agents there, and return. We'll see that you're rewarded."

- ~Ask to speak to a higher authority~

"Do you have an appointment?"

*Not as such...*

"Once you've proven yourself, perhaps."

- ~Leave the Admiralty~

"You don't have anything else for us?"

*Done*

Out into the foggy street. Turn your collar up.

** A Passenger

Someone in the docks wants to board your ship.

- ~Agree to carry the August Travel-Writer to the Gaider's Mourn.~

He's prepared to pay handsomely for transport, and is keen to commission your ship, specifically.

*Welcome aboard*

The August Travel-Writer shakes your hand. His grip is distressingly strong. "Thank you. It's Gaider's Mourn I'm bounded for first", he says. "I hear they - ah!" He hurries over to your stoker, who is carrying his steamer trunk up the gangplank. "No need to trouble yourself. Give it here. Remember, Captain - Gaider's Mourn. I'll pay you a hundred and fifty echoes when we arrive."

- ~Put your ship in Drydock~

For repairs, or sometimes other purposes...

- ~Good enough for now~

Your ship is in acceptable shape, thank you!

** Your Comatose Ferret

- ~Comatose Ferret (Mascot)~

Mostly, it's immobile. Occasionally, it's feral.

It lies across the deck like a lumpy scarf.

- ~Play with your Ferret~

Attract its attention.

*A weary roll of the eye*

Play, that eye-roll says. Play. I played once, in the happy warrens of London, before you installed me in this floating coffin and made me eat dried food. Damn your play. It is an eloquent eye-roll.

** Your Blemmigan Gallivanter

It has made its home on a shelf in your cabin. It has built a nest from loose journal pages, the engineer's scarf and a possibily pilfered map.

- ~Entertain your Blemmigan~

You can see the indentation of a porthole on the rim of its cap. It must have been pressing its face to the windows again. Is it bored?

*A ticklish thing*

The Blemmigan flails and squirms as you tickle it. Its high-pitched warble is almost certainly giggling. When you stop - to check that you're not actually hurting it - it warps its tendrils around your fingers and pulls your hand back. Apparently it is enjoying itself. 

** Speak to the Plausible Surgeon

"Hello, my dear, my dear. Sit down carefully. Just let me tidy away these implements. We don't want any carelessness, do we?"

- ~Ask after his desiers and ambitions~

He's travelled much, seen all manner of wound and malady. But is there anything left for him to discover? Any place he wishes to go?

*"The Chelonate"*

"You know it? They collect corpses." He shifts in his seat. "Vast, nobel, complicated /corposes/. What I cound learn! What I could see!"

"My dearest Captain - if we ever found ourselves in /the Chelonate/, I do hope you might see fit to release me from our arrangement."

* Quaker's Heaven

[[./pics/quakers heaven.PNG]]

Once, this simple fishing villiage was part of the London suburbs, before London fell and the waters rushed in. Smoke spirals from cottage chimneys. A lonely hill rises behind town.

- ~Explore the shore~

Wander a little way along the shore from the dock.

** A Glittering Eye

You turn, and there's a long, lank, brown man at your shoulder. "Listen", he says, "I have a story for you..."

- ~"I - "~

Something about the grey-beard compels your attention.

*A rambling tale*

His story has a wedding full of murders, a leafless forest and a vast serpent which eats souls. The tale winds on and on - like the serpent - until you are lost in the dizzy toils of its sinister ships and glamorous corpses...

You nod awake: he's gone. But not, it seems, before searching your pockets for small change.

- ~Chat to the fishermen~

They sail to the zee around the island: they mend thier nets by the harbour. They see all that happens here, but you'll need coin to open their mouths.

*Little ships and little scretes*

Pirates plying the waves. Smugglers at their work. Khanate ships putting in to resupply. Nothing dramatic, but enough to interest the Admiralty.

* Cumaean Canal Staging Area

The Canal ascends, through locks and gates and shadowed turns, to the sunlight of the Surface.

- ~Gather information for a Port Report~

Many ships pass this way, but perhaps you will pick up something they missed.

*Bussiness as usual*

The gates open and shuts. The locks remain free from sabotage. If anywhere besides London is safe in all the Underzee, it's here. The Surface nations have an interest in keeping the way open.

- ~Listen for Surface gossip~

The ships of Surface linger here: this is their life-line to a warmer place.

*A sorry end*

A card game ends badly when one Surface sailor knifes other for all the usual reasons. The other players scrabble for the coins spill from her pockets, but you snatch up a scrap of paper they overlook. Curious markings: dates, times, code-names. Spy's work?

* Iron Republic

Hell's client-state. Be wary. Their laws are not laws with Man or Nature.

Factory-engines roar like false lions. Blood thunders in the dock-pipes. Crimson lightning skitters acroos the deck, leaps to the rail, curls there like a cat. The city is reflected in glassy-calm harbour water: the citizens here have heads of dogs and serpents.

Hell has brought freedom to the Iron Republic: freedom from all laws, even those of nature.

- ~Engage an officer: the Irrepressible Cannoneer~ 

"Captain! Are you looking for a gunner? I'm looking for a ship! Here are may references!! Here are more references!! Here are my design for a whistling shell!! Here are my colleague!! (He'll stay on shore.) Here's my hand!!! Will you take it?"

*Welcome aboard!!*

"Oh, this is interesting. Room for improvement! There's always room for improvement! Wait: let me make notes. Paper!!"

- ~Compile a Port Report~

It won't be entirely straightforward. The streets won't lie straight, and the ink freezes whenever you look away from the inkwell.

*New passions*

The sensations of the Republic are overwhelming. This is a desire for years. That is a hatred for fountains. Here is an emotion that can only be expressed mathematically. Now you are awash of nostalgia of hatching of the egg. Write it down. Write it all down. Perhaps you'll be rid of it.

- ~MARKET OF HUNGERS: The Parliament of Flies~

The Market of Hungers, with its spires and sigils. Is it a parody of the Bazaar? Today, flies fill its arcades. Buzz, buzz.

*The murk folds*

** Shop 

- *House of Pleasures*

  The flies will caress you with their wings. Hurry up and purchase something.

* A White Zee-Bat

A zailor has grown fretful and disobedient, reluctant to go on deck, even in port. "There's a white zee-bat watching me up there. Salt's messenger. Salt's got its eye on me. I'll never see home again."

- ~Shoot the zee-bat~

If the b _ dy thing is frightning your b _ dy crew. You'll b _ dy well settle its hash.

*BANG*

It sees your intention and spreads its wings to flee: but your shot catches it, and it falls to the deck with a broken fluttering.

You cross the deck to collect the pale corpse. Your crew are utterly silent. No one catches your eye.

* Shipwrecked!

Your ship founders! There are screams - a flood of dark water - the unforgettable sound of a ship's spine breaking -

- ~Slip beneath the waves~

Perhaps you'll be remembered in song.

*No more*

Sleep.
